# finland_fake_data
Generator for fake Finnish data.  Right now, only generates names and geocoded addresses.

This code generates fake people and addresses for Finland (addresses are in Finnish).

Please note that in order for this code to work, you'll need to:

* Potentially change three directory references in the Python code
  * One at the top in each class
  * One in the general code at the bottom.
* Download the European address file from openaddresses.io and unzip it into the "openaddr-collected-europe" directory.

Address file download: https://data.openaddresses.io/openaddr-collected-europe.zip
